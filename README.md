# Hey, I’m Dr. Altayeb 👋🏽 — MD turned AI Automation Engineer

> *I got tired of watching healthcare drown in manual billing workflows. So I started building the fix.*

I’m a licensed Medical Doctor who crossed over into AI automation — specifically targeting the $4.5 trillion problem that is broken Revenue Cycle Management in US healthcare. I build intelligent workflows that kill manual claims processing, slash denial rates, and make prior auth stop being a nightmare.

## 🧠 What I Actually Do
Clinical Domain Knowledge  +  AI/Automation Engineering  =  RCM workflows that work

- 🤖 AI-powered RCM pipelines — n8n + LLM workflows for claims processing, eligibility checks, prior auth
- 🔁 RPA bots — UiPath automations built for real US clinic workflows (98% accuracy, 60% time savings)
- 🐍 Python scripting — ICD-10/CPT validation, AR aging analysis, denial trend detection
- 🏥 Clinical documentation — 6 years in Epic EHR across Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, OB/GYN
- 🔐 HIPAA-compliant — everything I build is built with compliance in mind from day one

## 📊 The Numbers Behind the Work

- ⚡ 60% reduction in claims processing time (UiPath bots, 3 US clinics)
- ✅ 98% accuracy rate across 40+ daily billing interactions
- 📋 60+ patient encounters documented weekly in Epic EHR
- 🧾 40% reduction in manual ICD-10/CPT review time

## 💡 Why I’m Different

Most RCM engineers have never seen a patient. Most doctors have never written a script.

I’ve done both — and that combination is exactly what AI-powered healthcare automation needs right now. I understand *why* a prior auth gets denied, not just *that* it did. I know what a coder gets wrong, not just that the claim failed. That clinical context makes every automation I build smarter.
